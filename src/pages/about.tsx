      How do the relationships between families and schools contribute to developing effective educational communities? 
      What practices can be implemented to strengthen collaboration and understanding between parents and educators, enhancing the overall educational environment?

      These are questions that the Families and Schools research study seeks to 
      address through the perspectives of parents, teachers, and principals 
      within San Antonio, Texas. Integrating these diverse perspectives allows 
      us to more holistically explore how parents and educators navigate the 
      school community, ultimately illuminating how these relationships may be 
      strengthened.

            Parents and educators interested in participating may complete a brief 
            demographic survey. This survey helps us ensure that we hear from parents 
            and educators of various backgrounds and school types. At the end of 
            the survey, you will be prompted to provide your contact information 
            for interview scheduling purposes only.
